# pose_detector
A human pose and hand gesture recognition system built with TensorFlow and MediaPipe.
Overview：
pose_detector is an advanced computer vision project that combines the power of TensorFlow and MediaPipe to detect and interpret human body language. 
The system extracts key landmarks from both full-body poses and hand movements, then applies a dual-approach analysis using rule-based inference and 
machine learning models to understand and classify human actions.
Features：
Real-time extraction of human body landmarks using MediaPipe
Detailed hand gesture recognition with 21 key points per hand
Dual analysis system:
Rule-based interpretation for immediate action recognition
Machine learning models for complex gesture classification
TensorFlow integration for model training and inference
Support for both image and video input processing
